Damn, baby
I like it
Damn
Hmm

Hey now, say now, I'm all about my Yen
Big face Buddha, get my peace from within
Send the kites to all my dirties in the pen
Let the honorary walk for the win, for the win
You crash out, then you better break the backboard
I got friends, hopin' that they make the tabloids
You know the last one figured he was Magneto
You play God, you gon' get what you ask for
We got the same twenty-four, what you mad for?
I put a square on his back like I'm Jack Dorsey
It's high beams if I make a public appearance
Go back to hidin' 'cause I'm not too friendly with niggas
One one thousand, two one thousand, four
The Black know I just strangled me a goat
I walked in with a therapeutic flow
Put a few hundred up, let 'em go, let 'em go

Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hmm, hey now, say now
Hey now, say now, I'm all about my Yen
Big face Buddha, get my peace from within
Send the kites to all my dirties in the pen
Let the honorary walk for the win, for the win
Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now

Hey now, say now, I done slid on they backstreet
Heavy on the Parmesan, every day tax season
What the fuck you wearin'? Bro, it's tacky
Niggas layin' on they death bed tryna match me
Oh my God, I'm 'bout to do the fool
They be screamin' out P, but they resume is boof
Switch both lanes, the engine sound like the zoo
Need a fee just to breathe, bitch, I can't talk to you
It's the Ben Frank murderer
Mister, I ain't heard of ya
Gulf streams, back to back, flyin' through the turbulence
Who is he? Free lunch, hmm, Kraft Services
Throw your ass out this rental if I smell nervousness
Hey now, say now, let me pop my shit
Water down my wrist, I'm around my bitch
It's a green light, don't get out of bounds, I'ma blitz
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's all blue strips
Nigga, what?

Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hey now, say now
Hmm, hey now, say now
I'm way too important
I'm way too important
I'm way too important to ever let you slide on me again

Startin' to see spaceships on Rosecrans (Startin' to see spaceships on Rosecrans)
I seen the aliens hold hands (I seen the aliens hold hands)
They wanna see me do my dance (They wanna see me do my dance)
I let 'em watch me do my dance

Who the fuck I feel like? I feel like Joker
Harley Quinn, I'm in the cut with a blower
Ayy, shit get spooky, every day in October
My torpedo even jumped out on smokers, J-Cat
Ayy, we mean muggin' niggas, Dody too important
If they talkin' 'bout playin' ball, me and my team gon' get to scorin'
If they talkin' 'bout playin' ball, they can take it up with Jordan
It's bald heads and the heckling for all endorsements
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe, I'm tryna tag a nigga toe
I'm aggressive on the beat and real life, niggas know
Ayy, I tatted up my body, it depend, level four
Ayy, I sharpened up a knife and came home to a blow
My bitch gon' get to tweakin' like she playin' with her nose
Lil' brodie 'bout to crash, man, y'all niggas be on go
I'm a different type of trophy, baby girl, I'm rose gold
Me and Dot get to slidin', put 'em in a choke hold
Bitches actin' like some niggas, niggas actin' like some hoes
Ayy, I jumped out that pan, then I jumped up in a Ghost
I'm the hush type of nigga, see my face, then he froze
All that shit he was talkin', found out he not that bold
Okay, this shit like forty, that's a dub, okay, let's add it up
Baby ass fat, can you do it? Can you back it up?
Kickflip a nigga, I got Tech Decks
And it ain't shit for me to call and get your chin checked
Tell 'em, "Dody did that"
