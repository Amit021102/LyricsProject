The type of skits I'm on, you wouldn't understand

Never got his ass whooped until we opened up that can
Damn, alley-oop me bands, I'ma slam, jam
Freak bitch, I like my MAC touchin' yams
Play that opp shit around me, I'ma tell you, "Turn it off"
Heard what happened to your mans, not sorry for your loss
Should've prayed before them shooters came and nailed him to the cross
I let your boy get a pass, bitch, you lucky he soft, for real
