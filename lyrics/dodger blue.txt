Ooh
Ooh

White diamonds, 2 a.m., she wildin'
Bitches sick, got their stomach in her comments
What school you went to? Gardena, Compton
Westchester, King/Drew, then we function
Little nigga, but that dog in me, that's on Top
On my kids, I'll sock you niggas up
Have you ever took a fade and ran three more back to back?
Oh, you haven't? Then shut the fuck up and keep it rap
Gah, gah, gah
Bitch, I'm from the LAnd
Don't say you hate L.A. when you don't travel past the 10
Am I trippin'? Yes, I am
Meditate over some money, I see Franklin, I find zen
Bitch, I'm from the LAnd
Don't say you hate L.A., but live in L.A. and pretend
My neck on Tarantino, Alejandro, Spike Lee
Just know you took the scenic route if you stand by me, stupid

So fly in this bitch
Fifty on me, don't die tryin' and shit (Ooh-ooh)
You know I'm up and down when I slide in this bitch
Dreamers and the Jets outside in this bitch
Westside, get the money, yeah, that's fo' sho'
Streets don't love you, better respect the code
Ain't no sleepin' in on Sunday
If it's 'bout the money, then my niggas on go

When I walk in, oh yeah, bring that
It's unanimous, how I pop shit
When I walk in, hoes better get in check
You lookin' at a bad bitch, nothin' less
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk
Tip, toe, pivot, walk
Tip, toe, pivot, walk

Ooh, don't take it personal
You won't be the first to know
Just might be the first to go
Just might be, ooh
Don't take it personal
You won't be the first to know
Just might be the first to go
Just might be
