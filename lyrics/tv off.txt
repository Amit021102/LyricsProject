All I ever wanted was a black Grand National
Fuck being rational, give 'em what they ask for

It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

They like, "What he on?"
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revelation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and make you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

Hey, turn his TV off
Ain't with my type activities? Then don't you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send 'em all
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I'm trippin' for my dog
Who you with? Couple sergeants and lieutenants for the get back
This revolution been televised, I fell through with the knick-knacks
Hey, young nigga, get your chili up, yeah, I meant that
Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that
Hey, what's up, though?
I hate a bitch that's hatin' on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a nigga hatin' on them niggas and they both broke
If you ain't coming for no chili, what you come for?
Nigga feel like he entitled 'cause he knew me since a kid
Bitch, I cut my granny off if she don't see it how I see it, hm
Got a big mouth but he lack big ideas
Send him to the moon, that's just how I feel, yellin'

It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough

Huh
Huh, huh
Hey
Hey (Mustard on the beat, ho)

Mustard
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

Ain't no other king in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'

Mustard (Ah, man)
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
