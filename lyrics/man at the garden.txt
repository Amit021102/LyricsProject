Twice emotional stability
Of sound body and tranquility
I deserve it all
Like minds and less enemies
Stock investments, more entities
I deserve it all
VVSs, white diamonds
GNX with the seat back, reclinin', bitch
I deserve it all
Put my homes on the beachfront
Flyin' private, what you eat for lunch?
I deserve it all
The respect and the accolades
Lampin' on the island, watchin' Cast Away
I deserve it all
For every good nigga that passed away
Sent two-point-five million on an average day
I deserve it all
Keep my name by the world leaders
Keep my crowds loud inside Ibiza
I deserve it all
More money, more power, more freedom
Everything Heaven allowed us, bitch
I deserve it all

Hmm, I deserve it all
Hmm, I deserve it all
All
All

'Cause my intentions was pure
Even when you wasn't sure
Even with every allure
How much temptation you endured?
You'd probably look for every cure
I said I deserve it all
I'm wakin' up at 6 a.m.
Six miles a day, conditionin' my wind
I said I deserve it all
I'm showin' up as your friend
Tellin' truths better than your next of kin
I said I deserve it all
I never ask for too much credit
Seekin' validation just for the aesthetics, bitch
I deserve it all
I see you as a human first
Even when you didn't understand your worth
Bitch, I deserve it all
It's innate to mind my business
Writin' words, tryna elevate these children
That's why I deserve it all
Pray for those who prayed against me
Every reason why my ancestors sent me
Bitch, I deserve it all

I deserve it all
I deserve it all
All
All

Put a smile on my mama
Good health and good karma
Yeah, she deserves it all
One hundred murals out in Compton
Remember me? I kept my promise
Yeah, we deserve it all
A better life for my daughter
Made my son take it further than his father
Yeah, he deserves it all
A close relationship with God
Whisper to me every time I close my eyes
He say, "You deserve it all"
Keep these bitch niggas away from me
Keep all my blessings faithfully
Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me
I burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me
I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me
I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see
More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me
Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me
Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?
How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak
On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me
It's important, I deserve it all because it's mine
Tell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker

I deserve it all
I deserve it all
